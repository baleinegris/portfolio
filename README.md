# Baleinegris portfolio website 

This website is a portfolio of my projects and skills! The project was created using React, Three.js (using React Three Fiber + React Three Drei), and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. It features cool 3d models (found free GLTF models of assets from Subnautica Below Zero!), as well as an integrated email system for contact and feedback!

This project runs containerized with Docker, and is served with Nginx on my Raspberry Pi 4. Check it out live at Live at [heathosc-medina.ddns.net](http://heathosc-medina.ddns.net)!
